# ACBR Unofficial Extensions

Since version 3.16.0, ACBR allows loading more localizations from external files (it has to be enabled in the advance preferences).
Some other type of files may me added in the future, like custom color themes.

 If you want to test that feature, or could find them useful, here are some unofficial ones I've made.

## Localization files

ACBR only includes human made translations but, if ACBR doesn't include your preferred language and don't mind using a machine translated one, here are some I've generated with Google Translate as a test. IMPORTANT: I have no clue about the quality of these machine translations, as I don't know the languages myself, I just decided to share them after a user suggested it in case someone else finds them useful.

- Français: fr.json (v3.15.0)
- Português (Brasil): pt-Br.json (v3.15.0)

If you want me to generate a new one for another language, let me know in the issues of ACBR's repository and I'll give it a try.
